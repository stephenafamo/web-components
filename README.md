## Development

To develop, close the repo and make any changes. There are several included scripts to make development easier:

* `npm run build`: Build a production bundle to the `dist` folder.
* `npm run build:watch`: Build a development bundle and watch for changes.
* `npm run start`: Start a development server looking for files in `demo/`. For local development, you should add a file at `demo/index.html`.
